# Google-Deepmind---Gemini
## Overview :

Gemini is a family of multimodal models designed to process and reason over both language and vision inputs in a tightly integrated manner. The goal of this repo is to:
- Provide a flexible baseline implementation of Gemini-like multi-modal transformers.
- Support inference and fine-tuning across text, images, or mixed input streams.
- Allow research exploration into cross-modal fusion, attention routing, and token alignment.

##  Key Features

- Multi-stream input processing (text and vision embeddings)
- Dual encoder-decoder transformer blocks
- Support for BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) and Patch embeddings
- Image adapter modules for various vision backbones (e.g. CLIP ViT-B, ResNet)
- Cross-attention fusion between modalities
- LoRA + QLoRA support for lightweight fine-tuning
- Training recipes for common datasets (e.g., VQAv2, COCO Captions, OK-VQA)
